This challenge can be solved with the help of netcat(nc) and nmap.We have a address given so we have to check for any port open on that host between(1453-3501).This can be done by
	nmap  -p 1453-3501 127.0.0.1 (look at the attached image for more info.)

After getting the open port what we have to do is to communicate with the port
	 nc 127.0.0.1 2989

This prints some stuff not rally important to us accept the last line.
(LLLSDLaserControl) and paste it on the command line
	  # LLLSDLaserControl
Then 
	  cat/home/level6/.pass

Do these things before the connection dies with the port.
