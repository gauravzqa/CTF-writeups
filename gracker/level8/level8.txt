A simple format string problem.The %08x character can be used to 
read the content of the stack.Having the addresses of all the registers 
and functions stored in the stack we can 
check the content of each register by using %s character.
I found the password at the 14 address by brute forcing all the 
addresses!
Looking for a better way to do it.
